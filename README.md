# phase-1-WK1-Code-Challenge
This repository contains solutions for three toy problems: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

The Student Grade Generator prompts the user to input student marks and generates the corresponding grade based on the mark ranges.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

The Speed Detector takes as input the speed of a car and checks if it exceeds the speed limit. It calculates the demerit points based on the speed and prints the total number of demerit points.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

The Net Salary Calculator calculates an individual's net salary based on the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

## How to Run

Each challenge has its own solution file. You can run the solutions in a JavaScript environment or a web browser console.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the desired challenge's solution file (e.g., `Student Grade Generator.js`, `Speed Detector.js`, `Net Salary Calculator.js`) in a text editor.
3. Run the JavaScript code in a JavaScript environment or paste it into a web browser console.
